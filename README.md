# ProcessMemoryScanner - File Path Analyzer

A Windows forensic tool that scans process memory to discover file paths and detect potentially deleted files. Useful for incident response, malware analysis, and digital forensics investigations.

## üîç Overview

ProcessMemoryScanner analyzes the memory of running processes and Windows services to extract file paths, then checks if those files still exist on disk. This helps identify recently deleted files, temporary artifacts, and potential evidence of malicious activity.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Memory Scanning** - Extracts file paths from process memory spaces
- **Service Analysis** - Scans critical Windows services for file references
- **File Existence Check** - Verifies if discovered files are present or deleted
- **Duplicate Filtering** - Shows unique paths per process to avoid redundancy
- **Color-Coded Output** - Visual indicators for present/deleted files
- **Export Functionality** - Save results to timestamped text files
- **Service Name Resolution** - Identifies specific services running under svchost.exe
